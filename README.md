# Marxia Café Ops Edge Workspace

This repository now separates deliverables for different presentation layers:

- `web-static/` – HTML/CSS/JS snapshot used for lightweight preview environments and analytics taps.
- `react-typescript/` – React + TypeScript workspace prepared for progressive app delivery alongside Flutter / Firebase clients.

Each track aligns with OPS CyberSec Core governance, keeping UX experimentation isolated from authenticated surfaces.
